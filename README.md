At my work I needed a code that would execute constantly added tasks in parallel.  
At the same time, in order not to load the database, the number of simultaneously executed tasks should be limited.  
A situation may arise where there are no tasks and there is a long waiting period, or, on the contrary, the number of tasks to be executed is very large.  
Since the old .net 4 version is used, many modern language constructs are not used.  
The code was kindly generated by AI `DeepSeek`.
